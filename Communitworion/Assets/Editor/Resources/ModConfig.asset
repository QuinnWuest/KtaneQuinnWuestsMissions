  description: "Imagine another bomb where another person asked 100 further community
    members what ONE module they wanted to see on another bomb. This is the result.\r\n\r\nThese
    were the rules for their module choice:\r\n- You must not be marked as a main
    contributor (Developer, Manual) of the module you choose. Only choose a module
    made by another person.\r\n- The module must be in the range of 4 to 30 points
    on Twitch Plays.\r\n- If the module is a boss module, it must be worth a maximum
    of 2 points per module.\r\n- If the module is a boss/semiboss module, it must
    not be able to strike due to lack of input or incorrect solve order.\r\n- The
    module must not be a needy/pseudoneedy module.\r\n- No duplicates.\r\n\r\n[url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vx8oGwlGeT-kV9-CKyz3GswnBVfaN16unB7hHOSbSUM/edit?usp=sharing]Spreadsheet
    with everyone's module choice can be found here.[/url]\r\n\r\nThanks to Timwi
    for the workshop preview image art!"
